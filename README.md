## FAQ

#### 1) How do I run my code?

- Type on the command line `$ npm run start` and type localhost on the browser.

#### 2) Where do I write my code?
Since this course focuses on HTML/CSS and there are two main places as follows:

1. HTML`./src/index.html` 
2. CSS `./src/assets/style/index.css` 
3. Images `./src/assets/img` 

New CSS should be placed in the `assets/style` directory.

__Note:__ remember that the JS workflow starts inside `window.onload`.

#### 3) I don't see my changes.

Everytime you change any file inside the `./src` folder the website public URL will automatically refresh the changes (it's a process called hot deploy)
Remember also to refresh cleaning the cache (command+shift+r on mac, control+shift+r on pc & linux)

#### 4) How do I publish the website?

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free github pages hosting. Publish your website by running:
```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

Very easy and in just one step!  

Push to your __master__ branch and use the free hosting that comes with 
[GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages), 
the project is ready to be published. Remember to choose to run the Github Page from your master branch.
